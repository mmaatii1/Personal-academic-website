## General info
It's one of my first 'bigger' website that I have made, so there might be some bugs e.g: problem with scalling on certain resolutions. Despite of that, website is fully 
responsive on mobile. In total there are seven pages, which are in polish btw. I added only two gif from main page to show you more appealing side of this site:D, and on others is 80% text, rest of it is styling and some ornaments. There is also a website counter.
## Gifs
